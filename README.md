# Graph Neural Network with Azure Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use Azure Machine Learning to build, train, and deploy a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using PyTorch Geometric.

## Features
- Connect to Azure ML Workspace
- Prepare and load data
- Define and train a GNN model
- Register and deploy the model in Azure ML

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- azure-ai-ml
- azure-identity
- torch
- torch-geometric

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Update your Azure ML workspace details in the script.
3. Run the main script to train and register your model.
